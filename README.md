# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML
My solution to the project Finding Donors for CharityML of the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning Nanodegree, also part of the former Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Term 1. The project entails finding the best potential donors for a charity. The notebook starts with data preprocessing, moves on to experimenting with different classification algorithms, then finetuning the hyperparameters of the one with the best F-score using grid search, and finally investigating the most important features for the classification, as given by the best classifier.
